# Session Storage Implementation - Complete âœ…

## Overview
The collaborative coding platform now has full session persistence that allows users to rejoin their rooms within 7 days.

## Features Implemented

### 1. 7-Day Session Storage
- Sessions are stored in MongoDB when a room is created
- Each session expires automatically after 7 days
- MongoDB TTL (Time-To-Live) index handles automatic cleanup

### 2. Recent Sessions UI in RoomModal
When you open the collaboration modal, you'll see:
- **Room ID** - in orange monospace font for easy identification
- **Participant Count** - shows how many people are/were in the session
- **Created Date** - when the session was created
- **Time Remaining** - shows days and hours until expiration (e.g., "6d 23h left")
- **Quick Rejoin** - just click on any session card to instantly rejoin

### 3. Auto-populated User Information
- Your name is automatically taken from your logged-in account
- The name field is read-only (gray background)
- Helper text shows "Using your account name"

### 4. Session Data Saved
Each session stores:
- Room ID (unique identifier)
- Creator name and user ID
- List of all participants with join/last seen timestamps
- Current code in the editor
- Selected programming language
- Last activity timestamp
- Creation date and expiration date (7 days)

## How It Works

### Creating a Room
1. Click "Create New Room" button
2. Your name is automatically filled from your account
3. System generates a unique room ID (e.g., "AA", "KZJDFV3W")
4. Session is saved to MongoDB with 7-day expiration
5. You enter the collaboration room

### Joining a Room
1. Click "Join Existing Room" or click a recent session card
2. For manual join: enter the room ID
3. For quick rejoin: just click on the session card
4. Your name is automatically filled
5. You join the room and can start coding

### Recent Sessions Display
- Shows up to 10 most recent sessions
- Sorted by last activity (most recent first)
- Only shows non-expired sessions
- Updates every time you open the modal
- Loading spinner while fetching data

## Technical Details

### Backend Files
- `backend/models/Session.js` - MongoDB schema with TTL indexing
- `backend/routes/sessions.js` - REST API endpoints for session management
- `backend/index.js` - Socket.IO integration for real-time updates

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/pages/CollaborationPage.jsx` - Creates sessions when rooms are created
- `frontend/src/components/collaboration/RoomModal.jsx` - Displays recent sessions with UI
- `frontend/src/components/collaboration/Compiler.jsx` - Passes userId to backend

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/sessions/create` - Create new session
- `GET /api/sessions/:roomId` - Get session by room ID
- `POST /api/sessions/:roomId/update` - Update session data
- `DELETE /api/sessions/:roomId` - Delete session
- `GET /api/sessions/user/:userId` - Get user's recent sessions (used by Recent Sessions UI)

### Database
- MongoDB collection: `sessions`
- TTL Index on `expiresAt` field with `expireAfterSeconds: 0`
- Automatic deletion when sessions expire
- Pre-save middleware updates `lastActivity` timestamp

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **Session Cards**: Gray background with hover effect (border turns orange)
- **Room ID**: Orange monospace font for tech feel
- **Icons**: Clock icon for Recent Sessions heading, Calendar icon for dates
- **Loading State**: Spinning loader while fetching sessions
- **Time Display**: User-friendly format like "6d 23h left" or "Expired"
- **Click Feedback**: Hover scale animation (1.01x) on session cards

### User Experience
- Zero friction rejoining - one click to return to your room
- Clear expiration indicators - always know how long you have
- Participant count - see if others are still active
- Chronological order - most recent sessions at top
- Scrollable list - up to 10 sessions visible
- Error handling - graceful fallbacks if API fails

## Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file has:
```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://compiler-design.onrender.com
```

## Installation
The required package `node-cron` has been installed for scheduled cleanup tasks.

```bash
cd backend
npm install node-cron
```

## Testing the Feature

1. **Create a Room**:
   - Go to collaboration page
   - Click "Create New Room"
   - Note the room ID generated

2. **Verify Session Storage**:
   - Check MongoDB database for new session document
   - Verify `expiresAt` is 7 days in the future

3. **Test Recent Sessions**:
   - Close the room
   - Open collaboration page again
   - You should see your recent session in the list
   - Click on it to rejoin instantly

4. **Test Expiration Display**:
   - Check that time remaining is calculated correctly
   - Format should be "Xd Yh left"

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Auto-save code changes to database during editing
- Restore session state (code and language) when rejoining
- Real-time session state sync across all participants
- Session expiration warnings (< 24 hours remaining)
- Graceful handling of expired session rejoins

## Fixed Issues
- âœ… Removed `setUserName` call that was causing error (userName is now computed from auth context)
- âœ… Fixed duplicate MongoDB index warning (removed redundant `index: true`)
- âœ… Installed missing `node-cron` dependency

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - All session storage features are working correctly!

## Support
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check MongoDB is running
2. Verify backend server is running on port 5000
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify user is logged in (required for recent sessions)
