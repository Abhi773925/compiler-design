- `call-offer`: Send WebRTC offer
- `call-answer`: Send WebRTC answer
- `ice-candidate`: Exchange ICE candidates
- `call-end`: End the video call
- `video-toggle`: Toggle video state
- `audio-toggle`: Toggle audio state

### Server ‚Üí Client

- `call-request`: Incoming call notification
- `call-accepted`: Call was accepted
- `call-declined`: Call was declined
- `call-offer`: Receive WebRTC offer
- `call-answer`: Receive WebRTC answer
- `ice-candidate`: Receive ICE candidate
- `user-left-call`: User left the call
- `user-video-toggle`: User video state changed
- `user-audio-toggle`: User audio state changed

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support

## Security & Privacy

- **HTTPS required**: WebRTC requires secure connections in production
- **Permission-based**: Requires user consent for camera/microphone access

- **Chat integration**: Text chat during video calls
- **File sharing**: Share files during calls
- **Whiteboard integration**: Shared whiteboard during calls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera/microphone not working**: Check browser permissions
2. **Cannot connect to other users**: Verify network/firewall settings
3. **Poor video quality**: Check internet connection speed
4. **Echo/feedback**: Use headphones or enable echo cancellation

### Error Messages
